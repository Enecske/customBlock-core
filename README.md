# customBlock-core

## Fabric

This Minecraft mod aims on adding custom blocks on server-side by overwriting existing blocks.

If you want to use it, just add it server-side and add a resource pack for your server.

I plan that you'll be able to add new blocks to the game via datapacks, but the mod is still in early dev, and I don't know when will I be able to finish it.

---
**Custom block types**
- Full blocks (Note Blocks)
- Soft blocks (Tripwires, unfortunately by adding these existing tripwires won't be useable)
- Leaves (Leaf Blocks)
- Non-full blocks with collision (Barriers, Player Heads)
- Fluids (I have no idea how to implement it, so I'm not sure if I'll add them)

 **WorldGen**
 
 There will also be settings to create
 - Trees
 - Ores
 - Formations (Rocks, Crystals)
 
 etc.
 
 **If you have any ideas on how to implement or make more efficient something you can always send me a message**
