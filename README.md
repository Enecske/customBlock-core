# customBlock-core

## Fabric

This mod aims on adding custom blocks on server-side by overwriting existing blocks.

If you want to use it, just add it server-side and add a resource pack for your server.

I plan that you'll be able to add new blocks to the game via datapacks, but the mod is still in early dev, and I don't know when will I be able to finish it.

---
**Custom block types**
- Full blocks (Note Blocks)
- Soft blocks (Tripwires, unfortunately by adding these existing tripwires won't be useable)
- Leaves (Leaf Blocks)
- Non-full blocks with collision (Barriers, Player Heads)
